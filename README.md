# HRG

## Description

This is a react version of the famous hangman's game.
Very simple, it is a good way to practice and learn or improve your React and Javascript promgramming skills.
Feel free to change the design, the file orgazation, and to add some features.

## Instructions

To launch the project if you are not familliar with react just use node js and type in console `npm start`

Soon, new changes will be made so that redux handles states in the app.

I might also: 
 - Install react-router to add some of the features a react app often needs.
 - Create a Score Board express API and others ranking like feature
 - An Api route that serves random Word to guess filtered by diffulty level from 1 up to 5 max
